## SoftAuthor Assistant

### Description

This was written originally as a shareware application, but due to other obligations and time constraints (as well as the need to see better documentation with programs) I have decided to release it to the public domain.

This program aids in documenting and submission of software created by the programmer. It can create DIZ, PAD, HTML, readme, license and press releases based on the program info you put in and the editing of the enclosed templates. pressing the '?' at the bottom of the tab screens will give much more detailed help.

After adding info about your company/program, go to the submit tab and you can generate your documents or submit via email or semi-auto submit to several websites. Apologies (and please no complaints!), but the address list and site list are a bit out of date (kudos to anyone who updates it).

There are bits and pieces of code that i have found around here and elsewhere, most have been improved considerably, and thanks and credits to all who contributed.
