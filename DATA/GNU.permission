GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE}c{Version 2, June 1991}c{}c{Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.}c{675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA}c{Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies}c{of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.}c{}c{Preamble}c{}c{The licenses for most software are designed to take away your}c{freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public}c{License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free}c{software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This}c{General Public License applies to most of the Free Software}c{Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to}c{using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by}c{the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to}c{your programs, too.}c{}c{When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not}c{price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you}c{have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for}c{this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it}c{if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it}c{in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.}c{}c{To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid}c{anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.}c{These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you}c{distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.}c{}c{For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether}c{gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that}c{you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the}c{source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their}c{rights.}c{}c{We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and}c{(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,}c{distribute and/or modify the software.}c{}c{Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain}c{that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free}c{software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we}c{want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so}c{that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original}c{authors' reputations.}c{}c{Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software}c{patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free}c{program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the}c{program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any}c{patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.}c{}c{The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and}c{modification follow.}c{}c{GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE}c{TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION}c{}c{0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains}c{a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed}c{under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,}c{refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"}c{means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:}c{that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,}c{either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another}c{language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in}c{the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".}c{}c{Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not}c{covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of}c{running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program}c{is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the}c{Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).}c{Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.}c{}c{1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's}c{source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you}c{conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate}c{copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the}c{notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;}c{and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License}c{along with the Program.}c{}c{You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and}c{you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.}c{}c{2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion}c{of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and}c{distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1}c{above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:}c{}c{a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices}c{stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.}c{}c{b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in}c{whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any}c{part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third}c{parties under the terms of this License.}c{}c{c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively}c{when run, you must cause it, when started running for such}c{interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an}c{announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a}c{notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide}c{a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under}c{these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this}c{License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but}c{does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on}c{the Program is not required to print an announcement.)}c{}c{These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If}c{identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,}c{and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in}c{themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those}c{sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you}c{distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based}c{on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of}c{this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the}c{entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.}c{}c{Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest}c{your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to}c{exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or}c{collective works based on the Program.}c{}c{In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program}c{with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of}c{a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under}c{the scope of this License.}c{}c{3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,}c{under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of}c{Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:}c{}c{a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable}c{source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections}c{1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}c{}c{b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three}c{years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your}c{cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete}c{machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be}c{distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium}c{customarily used for software interchange; or,}c{}c{c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer}c{to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is}c{allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you}c{received the program in object code or executable form with such}c{an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)}c{}c{The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for}c{making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source}c{code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any}c{associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to}c{control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a}c{special exception, the source code distributed need not include}c{anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary}c{form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the}c{operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component}c{itself accompanies the executable.}c{}c{If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering}c{access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent}c{access to copy the source code from the same place counts as}c{distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not}c{compelled to copy the source along with the object code.}c{}c{4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program}c{except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt}c{otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is}c{void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.}c{However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under}c{this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such}c{parties remain in full compliance.}c{}c{5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not}c{signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or}c{distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are}c{prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by}c{modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the}c{Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and}c{all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying}c{the Program or works based on it.}c{}c{6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the}c{Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the}c{original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to}c{these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further}c{restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.}c{You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to}c{this License.}c{}c{7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent}c{infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),}c{conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or}c{otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not}c{excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot}c{distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this}c{License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you}c{may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent}c{license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by}c{all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then}c{the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to}c{refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.}c{}c{If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under}c{any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to}c{apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other}c{circumstances.}c{}c{It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any}c{patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any}c{such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the}c{integrity of the free software distribution system, which is}c{implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made}c{generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed}c{through that system in reliance on consistent application of that}c{system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing}c{to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot}c{impose that choice.}c{}c{This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to}c{be a consequence of the rest of this License.}c{}c{8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in}c{certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the}c{original copyright holder who places the Program under this License}c{may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding}c{those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among}c{countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates}c{the limitation as if written in the body of this License.}c{}c{9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions}c{of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will}c{be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to}c{address new problems or concerns.}c{}c{Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program}c{specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any}c{later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions}c{either of that version or of any later version published by the Free}c{Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of}c{this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software}c{Foundation.}c{}c{10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free}c{programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author}c{to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free}c{Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes}c{make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals}c{of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and}c{of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.}c{}c{NO WARRANTY}c{}c{11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY}c{FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN}c{OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES}c{PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED}c{OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF}c{MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS}c{TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE}c{PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,}c{REPAIR OR CORRECTION.}c{}c{12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING}c{WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR}c{REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,}c{INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING}c{OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED}c{TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY}c{YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER}c{PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE}c{POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.}c{}c{END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS}c{}c{Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs}c{}c{If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest}c{possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it}c{free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.}c{}c{To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest}c{to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively}c{convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least}c{the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.}c{}c{<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>}c{Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>}c{}c{This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify}c{it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by}c{the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or}c{(at your option) any later version.}c{}c{This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,}c{but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of}c{MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the}c{GNU General Public License for more details.}c{}c{You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License}c{along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software}c{Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.}c{}c{Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.}c{}c{If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this}c{when it starts in an interactive mode:}c{}c{Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author}c{Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.}c{This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it}c{under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.}c{}c{The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate}c{parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may}c{be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be}c{mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.}c{}c{You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your}c{school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if}c{necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:}c{}c{Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program}c{`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.}c{}c{<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989}c{Ty Coon, President of Vice}c{}c{This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into}c{proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may}c{consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the}c{library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General}c{Public License instead of this License.}c{
