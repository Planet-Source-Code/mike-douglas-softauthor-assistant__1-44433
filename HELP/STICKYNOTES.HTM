<H2>Sticky Notes</H2>

Sticky notes are an invaluable addition to the Web Submitter portion of SoftAuthor.  Forget all those little yellow notes on your monitor with password and site information scribbled on them.  With sticky notes you can add a small scratchpad to save any information you wish that will be displayed when web submitter goes to that site.

To add a sticky note to a site press the <IMG SRC="browseadd.gif"> button while in the web submitter.
