<H2>Editing Document Templates</H2>


Document Templates are simply ASCII text files, editable in any text editor (such as notepad), with special "tags" that are replaced with data when the new document is generated.  
<BR><BR>
The tags all begin with "&#60;!--", have the tag name, and then end with "-->". A tag example would be &#60;!--NAME-->, anywhere "&#60;!--NAME-->" appeared in the template, it would be replaced with whatever value NAME held.
