<H2>Step-by-Step Getting Started Tutorial</H2>

SoftAuthor has much to offer the software author in terms of documentation and distribution of information.  Herein lies a brief overview of SoftAuthor's capabilities along with a first timer's step-by-step guide.  The steps outlined here are only for your first time using SoftAuthor and will change once you have a greater understanding of how to use SoftAuthor.

Help on individual screens can be found easily by clicking the <IMG SRC="browserhelp.gif"> button found in the lower right-hand side of each screen.

<H4>Update Data Files</H4>
Before starting any real work in SoftAuthor, it is a good idea to insure it's data files are up to date.  In the "submit" screen press the "Auto Update" button to connect to Aesgard Technologies and check for new data files, SoftAuthor will automatically install any new files it finds.

<H4>Create Company</H4>
A company entity must be created, this is where the consumer of the software product will go to for sales and support.  Often this will be done once for a single company setup where all of software products are being distributed by a single company. If there is no company, author information should be entered here. Save when complete.

<H4>Create Author</H4>
An author entity must be created, often this will mimic information in the company entity.  In cases where a company handles the work of several authors, multiple authors should be created. Save when completed.

<H4>Create Permissions</H4>
Although SoftAuthor comes with several permission styles, you may wish to create your own or alter those included to fit your current licensing and distribution needs. Save when completed.

<H4>Create Blurbs</H4>
Blurbs are re-usable "chunks" of text describing various first contact information about a software product such as installation and registration.  Often scanning through older projects you will be able to indentify your own blurbs in readme and documentation files. Save any blurbs you create.

<H4>Order Blurbs</H4>
Blurbs must be ordered so that when multiple blurbs are used in a document they appear in an order that makes sense. Simply click the "order" button on the blurbs screen and arrange the blurbs in the order you wish them to appear.

<H4>Create Program</H4>
Each product needs its own information.  Use the "program" and "program(cont)" screens to enter data about the software product.  Be aware of the following when entering URL's; the industry standard name for the XML file is pad_file.xml, the icon/screenshot files should be a JPG or GIF file.

<H4>Generate Documents</H4>
Go to the "submit" screen and under "generate docs" press the "all" button.  This will create several documents in  the OUTPUT directory.

<H4>Preview Documents</H4>
Look at the contents of each file in the OUTPUT directory. Did they come out how you wished? If not, you may wish to revise some of the data entries you made and possibly edit the templates used to create them (see <A HREF="TEMPLATES.HTM">Editing Document Templates</A> for help with templates).

<H4>Distribute Documents</H4>
Each document has a home. The FILE_ID.DIZ, LICENSE.TXT, and README.TXT files generally belong in the software distribution.  The INDEX.HTML and PAD_FILE.HTM should be uploaded to the product's information URL. PAD_FILE.XML should be uploaded to the XML file URL and the PRESSRELEASE.TXT should be distributed to any news services you wish to inform of your product.

<H4>Set-Up Mail</H4>
Configure SoftAuthor's e-mail settings in the "submit" screen.  Make absolutely sure the "From E-mail" and "Address"(Server) settings are correct.

<H4>Submit E-Mail</H4>
Select the addresses you wish to use in the "To:" selection and press "submit". A preview window will pop-up and show the contents of the e-mail you are about to send, make some minor adjustments if needed and press "ok". A console window will now appear giving detailed information about the mail send procedure.  When finished the console window will read "COMPLETE", you can then exit the console window.

<H4>Submit Web</H4>
Web submission is a bit more complicated and time-consuming than e-mail submission.  First, on the "submit" screen, select "web" under "submisiion type".  The screen changes to the web submission screen. Select the sites you wish to submit to and press "submit".  Your first selection will show in the browser, complete any information requested and when you feel the submission is complete don't forget to check the box beside the site's name to mark it complete.  Also, don't forget to use <A HREF="STICKYNOTES.HTM">Sticky Notes</A> to keep notes about user names, passwords and other information that would be required the next time you visit.  Sticky Notes can be added by using the <IMG SRC="browseadd.gif"> button when viewing a site.
